# Word and Character Count Report

This project is a Python script that reads a text file, counts the number of words and characters in the file, sorts the characters by frequency, and generates a report. This was my first Python project, and it was a great learning experience!

## Features

- Reads the contents of a specified text file.
- Counts the number of words in the document.
- Counts the occurrences of each character in the document.
- Sorts characters by their frequency in descending order.
- Displays a report with word and character counts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.3

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the desired `.txt` file in the correct directory, or update the file path in the script.
3. Run the script with the path to your `.txt` file as an argument:

   ```bash
   python main.py path/to/your/textfile.txt
