# Word and Character Count Report

This project is a Python script that reads a text file, counts the number of words and characters in the file, sorts the characters by frequency, and generates a report. This was my first Python project, and it was a great learning experience!

## Features

- Reads the contents of `books/frankenstein.txt`.
- Counts the number of words in the document.
- Counts the occurrences of each character in the document.
- Sorts characters by their frequency in descending order.
- Displays a report with the total word count and the frequency of each character.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the `books/frankenstein.txt` file in the correct directory.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
